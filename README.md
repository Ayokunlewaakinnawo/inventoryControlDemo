# inventoryControl_DataAnalysis
This is the codebase of developing new data piplines for gaining insight into the inventory of industrial parts , Order Line items, sales trend and other metrics and KPI listed below.

1. Total revenue generated: We can calculate the total revenue generated by multiplying the quantity of each item by its price and summing up the results for all orders.
Best-selling item: We can determine the best-selling item by aggregating the quantity sold for each model number and sorting the results in descending order.
2. Sales by manufacturer: We can group the data by manufacturer and calculate the total revenue generated by each manufacturer.
Average price per item: We can calculate the average price per item by dividing the total revenue generated by the total quantity sold.
3. Sales trends over time: If we have additional information such as the date of each order, we can analyze sales trends over time by grouping the data by date and aggregating the total revenue generated for each date.
Sales by region: If we have information about the region where each order was placed, we can group the data by region and calculate the total revenue generated by each region. This can help us identify regions with high or low sales and potentially adjust our marketing or sales strategy accordingly.
4. Seasonal sales trends: If we have information about the time of year when each order was placed, we can analyze seasonal sales trends by grouping the data by season (e.g. spring, summer, fall, winter) and aggregating the total revenue generated for each season. This can help us identify patterns in consumer behavior and adjust our inventory or pricing strategy accordingly.
5. Sales by channel: If we have information about the channel through which each order was placed (e.g. online, in-store, phone), we can group the data by channel and calculate the total revenue generated by each channel. This can help us identify which channels are most effective for generating sales and potentially adjust our resources or strategy accordingly.
6. Profit margins: We can calculate the profit margin for each item by subtracting the cost of the item (if available) from its price and dividing the result by the price. We can then calculate the average profit margin across all items to assess the overall profitability of our product line.
Customer demographics: If we have information about the demographics of our customers (e.g. age, gender, location), we can analyze sales trends and preferences by demographic group. This can help us tailor our product offerings and marketing strategy to better meet the needs and preferences of different customer segments.
Sales by salesperson: If we have information about the salesperson responsible for each order, we can group the data by salesperson and calculate the total revenue generated by each salesperson. This can help us identify high-performing salespeople and potentially adjust our sales incentive or training programs accordingly.
Sales by customer type: If we have information about the type of customer (e.g. individual consumer, small business, large corporation) who placed each order, we can analyze sales trends and preferences by customer type. This can help us tailor our marketing and sales strategy to better meet the needs of different types of customers. Product performance analysis: We can analyze the performance of individual products by calculating their sales volume, revenue, and profitability. This can help us identify products that are underperforming or overperforming and adjust our product strategy accordingly.
Price sensitivity analysis: We can analyze the relationship between price and sales volume by calculating the elasticity of demand for each product. This can help us identify the optimal price point for each product and potentially adjust our pricing strategy to maximize revenue and profitability.
Order fulfillment analysis: We can analyze the time it takes to fulfill each order (i.e. from the time the order is placed to the time it is delivered) to identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies in our order fulfillment process. This can help us improve our operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
Sales by product category: If we have information about the product category (e.g. electronics, appliances, clothing) for each item, we can group the data by category and calculate the total revenue generated by each category. This can help us identify high-performing product categories and potentially adjust our product offerings or marketing strategy to focus on these categories.
Customer retention analysis: We can analyze the percentage of customers who place repeat orders with us and identify patterns in their ordering behavior. This can help us develop strategies to improve customer retention and loyalty.
Inventory management analysis: We can analyze our inventory levels and identify products that are overstocked or understocked. This can help us optimize our inventory management strategy and avoid stockouts or overstocking.
Marketing campaign analysis: If we have information about the marketing campaigns we have run (e.g. email campaigns, social media ads), we can analyze the impact of these campaigns on sales volume and revenue. This can help us identify the most effective marketing channels and messages and adjust our marketing strategy accordingly. Competitor analysis: We can compare our sales performance to that of our competitors and identify areas where we may be losing market share. This can help us develop strategies to differentiate ourselves from our competitors and regain market share.
